# Introduction 
Converting helper do copy values between two objects shareing same interface.
It is using reflection, but caching the type name and property names it's really fast

# Getting Started
Install nuget

# Build and Test
Run all test methods. Test methods covers almost 100% of the possible cases

# Contribute
Put your improvements or additional code in your branch and create a pull request to dev branch

The rollout chain is: individual branch ==> dev ==> qa (pre-release nuget) ==> master (release nuget)
In case more than one developer does work on the project, the changes are merged in the dev branch.
Conflicts are resolved in the dev branch.
Best practise is you youse dev branch as base for your changes, since dev branch keeps all the latest commits.
